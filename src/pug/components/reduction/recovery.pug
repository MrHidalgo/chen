        h2.recovery__title.c-title(data-aos="fade-up") Breast Reduction?
        p.recovery__desc.c-desc(data-aos="fade-up") A breast reduction involves removing excess breast tissue and skin and repositioning the breast tissue and nipple-areola complex higher on the chest wall. The patient will have a lollipop scar that consists of a scar around the areola and a vertical scar from the areola to the inframammary fold. Often, a breast reduction will make a woman look like she has lost weight, even if only a small amount of breast tissue has been resected. It will also make her breasts look younger and perkier.

        p.recovery__desc.c-desc(data-aos="fade-up") After a breast reduction, drains are sometimes needed if a large amount of tissue has been moved around. There are dressings on the incisions, which remain in place for at least 48-72 hours. After the dressings are removed, the patient can shower. Many patients can return to work in 1-2 weeks. Patients should avoid heavy lifting for 6-8 weeks. The breasts will be swollen initially, but the swelling subsides and the breasts settle over several months.
